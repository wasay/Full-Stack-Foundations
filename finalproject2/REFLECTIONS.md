Lesson 4 - Tackling a Complex Project - Reflections:

Q: There are several different ways to go about tackling a complex project. 
Compare and contrast some of the pro's and con's of a "top-down" approach
focusing on the front-end first versus a "bottom-up" approach that focus
on the database and server-side code first. Share your synthesis with
your fellow classmates.

A: I believe the "top-down" approach will work out best for developers and clients.
As the front-end concept will reduce the guessing game of what is important and how soon it needs to be delivered.

Front-end
    Pros:
        Customer can review and approve concept for how the front-end will application will flow or look.
        Reviews of the concept helps in eliminating pending requirements gathering sections to be tabled or placed on hold.
        Having the concepts gives a better understanding of how the database structure needs to be setup
    Cons:
        Slow go to get approaval of concepts
        Once programming is started the concepts may continue to change requiring more work
        Manually have to add content to support front-end views until backend is build
                
Back-end
    Pros:
        Allows the developer's to design the database with flexibility
        Reduces the concept approval to home page and content page
    Cons:
        May require significant database changes, rippling to more code changes
        Application may not be ready for review until back-end and front-end is done
